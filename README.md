# final-390

Contains my rmd and pdf files for the midterm paper along with the rmd file and knitted html file I used for the novel analysis. This paper critiques the methodology and normative nature of a paper called "Probability of mortality of critically ill cancer patients at 72 h of intensive care unit (ICU) management" where the authors attempt to make a model to predict the probability of a patient in ICU after 72 h of care to die. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00520-003-0498-9#citeas
